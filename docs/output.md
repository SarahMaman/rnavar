# nf-core/rnavar: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

* [Preprocessing](#preprocessing)
    * [cat](#cat) - Merge re-sequenced FastQ files
    * [FastQC](#fastqc) - Raw read QC
* [Alignment](#alignment)
    * [STAR](#star) - Fast spliced aware genome alignment
* [Alignment post-processing](#alignment-post-processing)
    * [SAMtools](#samtools) - Sort and index alignments
    * [Picard MarkDuplicates](#picard-markduplicates) - Duplicate read marking
    * [GATK4 SplitNCigarReads](#gatk4-splitncigarreads) - Splits reads that contain Ns in their cigar string (e.g. spanning splicing events in RNAseq data)
    * [GATK4 Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR)](#gatk4-bqsr) - Estimate and correct systematic bias that affect the assignment of base quality scores by the sequencer
* [Other steps](#other-steps)
    * [Picard BedToIntervalList](#picard-bedtointervallist) - Converts a BED file to a Picard Interval List
    * [Picard IntervalListTools](#picard-intervallisttools) - Scatter one interval-list into many interval-files to run analysis in parallel
* [Variant calling](#other-steps)
    * [GATK4 HaplotypeCaller](#gatk4-haplotypecaller) - Call SNPs and indels via local re-assembly of haplotypes
    * [GATK4 MergeVCFs](#gatk4-mergevcf) - Merge multiple VCF files into one VCF
    * [GATK4 IndexFeatureFile](#gatk4-indexfeaturefile) - Index the VCF
* [Variant filtering](#other-steps)
    * [GATK4 VariantFiltration](#gatk4-variantfiltration) - Hard-filtering variant calls based on certain criteria
* [Quality control](#quality-control)
    * [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Present QC for raw reads, alignment, read counting and sample similiarity
* [Workflow reporting and genomes](#workflow-reporting-and-genomes)
    * [Reference genome files](#reference-genome-files) - Saving reference genome indices/files
    * [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### FastQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `fastqc/`
    * `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
    * `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

</details>

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

> **NB:** The FastQC plots displayed in the MultiQC report shows _untrimmed_ reads. They may contain adapter sequence and potentially regions with low quality.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `multiqc/`
    * `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
    * `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
    * `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

* `pipeline_info/`
    * Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
    * Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
    * Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
